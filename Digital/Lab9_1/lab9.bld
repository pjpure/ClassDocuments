ERROR:ConstraintSystem:59 - Constraint <NET "clk" LOC = P123;> [clock.ucf(12)]:
   NET "clk" not found.  Please verify that:
   1. The specified design element actually exists in the original design.
   2. The specified object is spelled correctly in the constraint source file.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem - A target design object for the Locate constraint
   '<NET "clk" LOC = P123;> [clock.ucf(12)]' could not be found and so the
   Locate constraint will be removed.
