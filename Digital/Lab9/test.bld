ERROR:ConstraintSystem:59 - Constraint <NET "com2" LOC = P33;> [test.ucf(26)]:
   NET "com2" not found.  Please verify that:
   1. The specified design element actually exists in the original design.
   2. The specified object is spelled correctly in the constraint source file.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem - A target design object for the Locate constraint
   '<NET "com2" LOC = P33;> [test.ucf(26)]' could not be found and so the Locate
   constraint will be removed.
